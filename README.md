Assignment 3.1
In this Assignment we had to create a "catcher". I had the idea pretty quickly after this assignment was given
to create a bucket that catches an object of some kind. I had a bit of trouble at first making the bucket look good,
but I was able to mess with the coordniates to make it look like a bucket. I also had a bit of trouble making clouds
at first, but eventually I figured out that I could makes a series of ellipses near each other and increates the size
of the drawClouds function when I called it back. Overall, didn't have much trouble with part 1.

Assignment 3.2
For assignment 3.2 we had to "click to change the catcher". I new how to make the cgange happen, so in the coding
sense, I didn't have any issues. In the creative sense, I wasn't sure what to change the bucket to. Since it's a bucket
it can't really emote, so I knew it just had to change color when I clicked. I eventually decided to make it gold.
In this process I had to add two new callbacks in the drawBucket function that let me change the color of the bucket
AND the color of the bars on the bucket. It took me a little while to figure out what color to make the bucket bars,
but I figured uit out and made it change to a golden bucket when clicked.

Assignment 3.3
For this assignment we had to have an object fall. I had the idea to make it an apple fall that you would catch in the
bucket, I made in the previous questions. The only problem's I had with the apple was making the stem noticable when
I made the apple smaller. I made the rectangle fill with brown, I would eventually remove this later, but at the time
I liked how it looked. After the creating the object that fell, I created code that would allow it to fall at a random
spot on the X axis. I did this with relative ease, the only thing was that it's wouldn't drop at a diffirent speed
each time I clicked, only when I reset the output, either way I didn't worry about it to much.

Assignment 3.4
This assignment took the leat amount of work compared to all the others. All I had to do was change the apple to ONLY
fall when I clicked, instead of autiomatically. I didn't really have any issues with the question, did it pretty
quickly and moved on. I think if I went back I would've thought out what I would do for question five because I had to
do alot for that one. Regardless, I still was happy with what I had.

Assignment 3.5
This question requied the most amounnt of work, BUT it also was a lot of fun and very satisfying to see the final
result. First I wanted to actually complete the goal of making the bucket turn gold when the apple hit the bucket.
I had serious trouble with this at first, I couldn't figure out how to make this work. After taking a break and
going to the lab, I learned about dist() and I used this piece of code. This changed the bucket, but I couldn't seem
to figure out how to make it work EXACLY at the bucket. After looking through my classmates assignments, I was able
to mess around with it and make it work! It was such a relieve when it finally worked. I still wasn't done though, I
wanted to make the game a bit more uniqe, so I added an ending screen and a point system.  had to look at the p5.js
refrence and some other pieces of codes, but slowly I was able to create an actualy game that I'm really proud of!!!
